          <p>“I had the pleasure to have Teddy as the student during our last bootcamp in web developpement on the Wagon Nice campus, from the very first days Teddy has shown great implication for the program. He has proved during the projects also that he can be a great leader since he was the one who managed the project team he was working with. Thanks to the project, Teddy has been able to develop strong competencies in coding especially on the front end part. I strongly recommend Teddy as a front end developer.”</p>
